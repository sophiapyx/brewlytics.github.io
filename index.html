          quick-service eateries, 135 full-service and sit-down restaurants, 110 retailer dealers, and 78 liquor primary
          businesses.
        </h2>

        <h2>Yet in July 2025, the Vancouver Sun released an article talking about how a lack of customers is causing
          strain to the restaurant industry, which in turn affects 27 other sectors.

        <h3>To understand what this looks like on a micro scale, we zoomed in on V6E, a dense and highly competitive
          area in the heart of Downtown Vancouver.

            The Piccolo brothers, who have often been dubbed as the “Godfathers of coffee in Vancouver”, opened 49th
            Parallel Coffee in 2004, helped kickstart the Third Wave Coffee movement, which focuses on the nuanced
            flavor of the beans themselves and where coffee is meticulously prepared and served in quality glassware or
            ceramics and highlights single origin coffees through pour overs and classic espresso beverages. Since then,
            specialty coffee has become a major part of the city’s identity, and that is visible in our dataset as well.

        <h2>Japanese restaurants are everywhere, but they tend to stay open for less time on average, while something
          like an Italian restaurants, although there are fewer restaurants, actually have longer lifespans</h2>

        <h3>Even cafés, despite their cultural significance, don’t seem last as long as the Italian establishments too

        <h3>Digging deeper, we noticed that several addresses had multiple restaurants open in the same space across
          different years.
          This suggests a high level of turnover, restaurants closing, new ones taking over the same units, and the
          cycle repeating. The neighbourhood constantly reshapes itself, reflecting changing trends, competition, and
          business pressures.</h3>

        <h2>So what does this all mean? To understand the bigger picture, we need to look at the intersection of
          culture, economics and shifting consumer behaviour
        </h2>

    </section>

    <section id="growing-asian-population">
      <div class="panel">

        <h3>There could be a few reasons as to why there are so many Japanese restaurants:
          <ul>Vancouver has one of the largest Asian populations outside of Asia</ul>
          <ul>The fact that the ocean gives us access to fresh fish</ul>
          <ul>The fact that Vancouver created the California Roll</ul>
          <ul>The large immigrant population also leads to fusion dishes such as sushi taco, sushi pizza, etc.</ul>
        </h3>

        <h2>Cultural demand makes Japanese restaurants open frequently, but that doesn’t always ensure they stay open.
        </h2>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="economics">
      <div class="panel">

        <h3>Economics can also be another factor.
          The fact is, there are so many Japanese restaurants that are evidently saturating the area, creating more
          competition, potentially leading to shorter lifespans. Meanwhile the stark contrast when it comes to how many
          Italian restaurants means they face less competition, and are therefore, more likely to survive
          Oversupply seems to shorten lifespans, while niche, differentiated restaurants tend to last longer. Ultimately
          being popular doesn’t always guarantee survival!

        </h3>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="economics-continued">
      <div class="panel">

        <h3>Economic pressures extend far beyond competition. Restaurant rent in Vancouver can range from $3,500 to
          $15,000 per month, and in some cases, much higher. For example, Cioppino’s Mediterranean Grill in Yaletown
          closed in 2024 after 25 years when its monthly rent jumped to $60,000.
          With rising costs in:</h3>
        <ul>Rent</ul>
        <ul>food and ingredients</ul>
        <ul>Utilities</ul>
        <ul>labour</ul>
        <h3>
          …restaurants face increasingly tight margins.
          Combined with heavy competition, these pressures can contribute to frequent turnover in such areas.
        </h3>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="consumer-behaviour">
      <div class="panel">

        <h3>Consumer behaviour has also shifted dramatically.According to Michelin-starred chef J-C Poirier and Chambar
          co-owner Kerri Green:
          <ul>There’s a shortage of staff, forcing restaurants to reduce hours</ul>
          <ul>Downtown foot traffic has dropped: “There’s no one downtown… People aren’t going out after work”</ul>
          <ul>Guests now prefer affordable and fast options</ul>
          <ul>When people’s personal budgets shrink, dining out is often the first expense people cut</ul>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Social media and Michelin listings, built hype to boost the restaurant’s popularity, but that the novelty has
          worn off, with Poirier saying “There was excitement at first, but now people care less.” He adds: “In Europe,
          people embrace that dining experience. Here, people want good food and good value, without being overly
          challenged.”
          These shifting habits add yet another layer to the challenges restaurants face today.

    <section id="summing-it-up">
      <div class="panel">

        <h3>So what does this all mean?
          The lifespan of restaurants are shaped by three key forces working together:
          <ul>Culture influences what types of restaurants open</ul>
          <ul>Economics determines which ones can survive</ul>
          <ul>Consumer habits have changed and not for the better</ul>
        </h3>
        <h3>So is it because certain cuisines are more popular than others or social media hypes up a specific new
          restaurant? Maybe, but also looking at how the three factors interact together in a neighbourhood that is
          constantly shifting and reinventing itself is crucial to its success.
        </h3>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <div class="panel">

        <h3>Restaurants open, close, and reopen under new names, not because the neighbourhood is failing, but because
          it is dynamic, competitive, and continually evolving.
          Our data shows:
          <ul>Popular cuisines appear quickly but also churn quickly</ul>
          <ul>Less saturated categories are more likely to remain open</ul>
          <ul>The neighbourhood’s design naturally encourages experimentation and renewal</ul>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          In many ways, our data reflects Vancouver’s food culture as a whole: diverse, fast-moving, culturally driven,
          economically pressured, and always hungry for something new.
