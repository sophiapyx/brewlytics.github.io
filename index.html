        The Piccolo brothers, who have often been dubbed as the “Godfathers of coffee in Vancouver”, opened
        49th Parallel Coffee in 2004, helped kickstart the Third Wave Coffee movement, which focuses on the
        nuanced flavor of the beans themselves and where coffee is meticulously prepared and served in quality
        glassware or ceramics and highlights single origin coffees through pour overs and classic espresso
        beverages. Since then, specialty coffee has become a major part of the city’s identity, and that is
        visible in our dataset as well.

        <ul class="gap-list">
         <li>Vancouver has one of the largest Asian populations outside of Asia</li>

      <h3>
        Economics can also be another factor. The fact is, there are so many Japanese restaurants that are evidently
        saturating the area, creating more competition, potentially leading to shorter lifespans. Meanwhile the stark
        contrast when it comes to how many Italian restaurants means they face less competition, and are therefore, more
        likely to survive Oversupply seems to shorten lifespans, while niche, differentiated restaurants tend to last
        longer. Ultimately being popular doesn’t always guarantee survival!

          closed in 2024 after 25 years when its monthly rent jumped to $60,000.

          people embrace that dining experience. Here, people want good food and good value, without being overly
          challenged.” These shifting habits add yet another layer to the challenges restaurants face today.
